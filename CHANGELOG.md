## Unreleased

### Added

- `ApiWeld.Core`: normalize an OpenAPI description in one call, `OpenApiNormalizer.Normalize`.
  It runs format substitution, then collapses unions down to a single permissive shape, then
  folds identical referenced component schemas onto one canonical name and rewrites references
  to match. See the README's "Union collapse rules", "Deduplication rules", and "Order of the
  passes" sections for exactly what each stage does and why they run in that order.
- `ApiWeld.Cli`: an `apiweld normalize <description.json>` command. It writes the normalized
  result next to the input as `<name>.modified.json`; if the description is already normal, it
  writes nothing and reports that the document is unchanged. Bad input (a missing file, or a
  description whose root is not an object) exits non-zero with a message describing the problem.
